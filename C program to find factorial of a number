C program to find factorial of a number

In this program, we will read and integer number and find the factorial using different methods - using simple method (without using user define function), using User Define Function and using Recursion.

What is factorial?
Factorial is the product of an integer with it's all below integer till 1. In mathematic representation factorial represents by ! sign.

For Example:
Factorial 5 is:
5! = 120 [That is equivalent to 5*4*3*2*1 =120]


#include <stdio.h>


int fact(int n){
    
    if(n==0||n==1)
    return 1;
    
    return n*fact(n-1);
    
}

int main()
{   
    int n;
    printf("enter the number\n");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    
    printf("Factorial of %d is %d",n,fact(n));

    return 0;
}
